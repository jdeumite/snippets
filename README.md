Hi,

Here are a few short examples of code I've worked on.

Paginator/Paginator Buttoner - Paginator.js accepts an array of data objects, and prints them in a simple list (using a map list function passed down to the Paginator as props).  It renders the data list with paginator button functionality including prev/next arrows, numbered tabs, and a dropdown to select items per page.  Paginator is a class PureComponent, while paginator buttoner is a functional component.  Pagionator buttoner maps the tabbed buttons in addition to adding ellipsis between first/last and local page tabs when appropriate
