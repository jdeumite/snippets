Hi,

Here are a few short examples of code I've worked on.

PaginatorButtoner:
Pagionator Buttoner is a react functional component that returns a JSX array that renders as pagination buttons.  it accepts as props: the number of pages, the maximum possible page, and the function onTabClick, which handles setting the state of a new tab upon tab click, and therefore the rendering of the selected page.
